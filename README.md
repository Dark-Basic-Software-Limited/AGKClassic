# AppGameKit Classic
The home of the last version of that incredible cross-platform programming language AppGameKit Classic. The product was retired after 10 years on Steam and is no longer officially supported by DBS.

## Introduction

AppGameKit Classic was feature packed with over 1,900 commands, and this source code represents an upload of the code as it stood for Build 2022.06.27. The code has not been modified since transferring from the old SVN repository to the new GitHub repository, and it is expected community contributions will be required to restore its ability to compile all modules, executables and IDE.

## Source Code Access

The code provides access to the AppGameKit Classic Tier 2 engine, complete with instructions on how to gather the prerequisites, dependencies and other files required to compile, test and run your own implementation of the AppGameKit Libraries for PC and Mac.

## Community Collaboration

Where possible we recommend any new commands are coded in C++ so that they are cross platform, and tested for Windows, Mac, Android and Apple before they are accepted into the master branch.
