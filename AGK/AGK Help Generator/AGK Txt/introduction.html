            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
            During mid 2010 the team at the Game Creators realised they needed a fresh new development tool to take advantage of the myriad of mobile devices hitting the market on an almost daily basis. Our past products like Dark Basic Professional had served us and our customers well but they were not future proof and were stuck on a single PC platform. The team had also played with a number of new mobile platforms such as iOS, Android, Samsung Bada, Palm OS and others. We had made apps for these devices and then suffered a painful translation process trying to publish the best apps onto different devices. Out of all of this was born the idea of AGK. We wanted a tool that allowed you to create your game once and then deploy it across multiple devices. It would handle everything from resolution issues, player input and above all it would be very easy to learn and use.
            </p>

            <p>
            We're proud to be releasing this first community edition of AGK and feel that it's a great foundation on to which we will add more platforms. We feel we have remained true to our roots in keeping the process of making games as simple and as flexible as possible and we aim to work with our community to make this one of the best cross platform game development tools.
