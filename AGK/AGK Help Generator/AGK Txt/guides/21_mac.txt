Macintosh - OS X

_text
This guide explains the process involved in creating projects when using Tier 2 when using the Macintosh - OS X platform.

_sheader
What you need

_listbegin
Xcode 6
Mountain Lion 10.8 or higher
_listend

_sheader
Setup

_text
When you first run the AGK IDE you will be prompted to install the AGK Projects and C++ libraries to a location of your choice. If you only intend to use the C++ libraries you can ignore the AGK Projects and just install the C++ libraries, then close the AGK IDE. If you wish to do this process again at a later date you can access it from the <b>Tools -> Install Addiitonal Files</b> menu option.

_sheader
Creating a project
_text
Within the <b>apps</b> folder there is a sub folder name template_mac. This is the template that contains all the project settings and initial code to get you started on the MacOS platform. You can either open the project and start editing it, make a copy in the same folder, or copy the project and place it elsewhere. Please bear in mind that if you take the latter option you will need to update links to the include and library files.

_text
The include files can be found at:

_listbegin
common/include
_listend

_text
While the library files are available from:

_listbegin
platform/mac/lib/Release
_listend

_text
You link to the release version of the library for both Debug and Release builds.

_sheader
Opening a project

_text
Now follow these steps to open the project:

_listbegin
Launch the Xcode IDE.
Go to the "File" menu and select "Open".
The next step is to locate the folder for your project. Navigate to the directory of your project e.g. apps/MyGame_mac then press "Open".
_listend

_sheader
Project files

_text
With the project now opened it's time to explore the files, with the main ones of concern being in the "classes" folder, expand this and you will be presented with three files: template.cpp, template.h and CoreForApp.h. The main source files of interest are template.cpp and template.h. The file template.h contains a class definition for our application and template.cpp contains the implementation, which has three functions laid out. The function Begin gets called at the start of the application and can be used to handle initial set up. The function Loop gets called on a continual basis and is effectively your main loop. Finally the function End will be called when the application is about to terminate.

_text
Another area of interest is within the "Other Sources" folder, within here is a file named "Core.mm". This code deals with platform specific functionality and may be useful for advanced users.
