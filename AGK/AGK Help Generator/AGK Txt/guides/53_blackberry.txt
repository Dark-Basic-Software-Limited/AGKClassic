Part 1: Preparing the AGK Player project

_text
It is VITAL that ALL paths do not contain ANY spaces

_text
Copy	
_listbegin
IDE/common
IDE/platform
IDE/apps/interpreter
including all sub-folders and files
_listend

_text
to	
_listbegin
c:/ndk-2.1.0-workspace/common
c:/ndk-2.1.0-workspace/platform
c:/ndk-2.1.0-workspace/interpreter
_listend

_text
Copy contents of the new AGK/IDE/apps/interpreter_blackberry (Inc sub-folders and files)to C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace/AGKPlayer

_text
Navigate to the new NDK workspace (default=C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace\)

_text
Enter the AGKPlayer folder and open the .cproject file in Notepad

_text
Click Edit > Find and type E: in the search box then click Find Next. Once you find the line reading: value="E:/Programs/PlaybookNDK/target/......" change it to: value="C:/bbndk-2.1.0/target/......". You can press F3 (or click Find Next) to find the next instance of E:, again, change the portion 'E:/Programs/PlaybookNDK/' to 'C:/bbndk-2.1.0/'

_text
Do this for all four instances of the E: drive path,

_text
In addition edit the two occurrences of {ProjDirPath}/../../common to {ProjDirPath}/../common and the two occurrences of {ProjDirPath}/../../platform to {ProjDirPath}/../platform and then save the file.

_text
Now close Notepad.

_text
Launch the Blackberry SDK 2.1.0

_text
Allow it to select the default workspace (C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace). It is VITAL that ALL your paths do not contain ANY spaces. Right click the 'AGKPlayer' project. Select Build Configurations, then Set Active > Device-Release. Now select Clean Project, then select Build Project. All the error warnings should now disappear from the project and files. The project has now been built.

_text
If the error "Package failed, invalid asset path" use the following method to fix....

_text
Edit bar-descriptor (use Wordpad), find... 

_text
<asset type="Qnx/Elf" path="${QNX_TARGET}/../target-override/${CPUVARDIR}/usr/lib/libbps.so">lib/libbps.so.1</asset>

_text
remove /../target-override/ to leave

_text
<asset type="Qnx/Elf" path="${QNX_TARGET}/${CPUVARDIR}/usr/lib/libbps.so">lib/libbps.so.1</asset>

_text
Right click the 'AGKPlayer' project and select Export. Choose Blackberry Tablet OS and choose Release Build. Leave everything as default and click next

_text
enter CSK Password:

_text
Blackberry AGK Player is then built, the .bar file is then found in device-release folder, I then set my Playbook to development mode, connect to the PC and use DDPB to transfer and install the finished .bar file to my Playbook.

_sheader
Part 2: Preparing your own tier 1 application

_text
It is VITAL that ALL paths do not contain ANY spaces

_text
Important Note from AGK V108beta18 README.txt file

_text
Limiting an app to portrait or landscape in the Blackberry player project is controlled in the bar-descriptor.xml file in the Application tab. Set the Orientation field to portrait, landscape, or auto-orient for all 4 directions. You must also change Core.cpp where is says

_text
if (EXIT_SUCCESS != bbutil_init_egl(screen_ctx, GL_ES_2, PORTRAIT)) 

_text
to read LANDSCAPE if needed instead.

_text
Now you have successfully created and built the AGK Player, you are ready to make your own app project

_listbegin
Now quit the IDE as the next changes are to be applied outside of the IDE
First copy the C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace\AGKPlayer project and paste it back into the workspace, rename it to your own app title (e.g. myapp)
Open the new C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace\myapp folder,
Delete the following temporary folders and their files which we won't need: Device-* and Simulator-*
Also delete README.txt (see note above)
Now open icon.png and replace the icon with the one for your app, keep the dimensions at 86x86 pixels.
Copy all the assets from your T1 applications media folder into the assets\media folder in the project
For example, your bytecode file should be at C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace\myapp\assets\media\myapp.byc (any sub-folders that your app needs should be in the assets\media folder too.)
Ensure you rename the .BYC file to bytecode.byc, ensuring the spelling and case are identical
Open the .cproject in NOTEPAD and select Edit > Replace...
Type AGKPlayer into the find field and myapp into the replace field (where myapp is the name of your project folder) [six instances]
NOTE: The above is destructive so ensure your spelling is perfectly correct
Now save and close notepad
Do the same with the .project file, ensuring all instances of AGKPlayer are replaced [two instances]
Open the bar-descriptor.xml file in Notepad and perform the same search replace on that one too [six instances]
NOTE: Ensure you match the case as there are lower case versions of agkplayer which must not be replaced yet
Find and replace com.thegamecreators.agkplayer with com.yourcompany.myapp
The text 'yourcompany' is the company/team/name you wish to publish your app under
The text 'myapp' is the name of your application, in this example myapp (so: com.acme.myapp)
Replace 'The AGK Player for Blackberry QNX devices' with your own app description (This can contain spaces and upper case characters)
WE are almost ready to launch the IDE again. Before you do, MOVE the entire folder out of the C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace\myapp folder, somewhere safe. (Note: this is a CUT and PASTE) operation.
Right click on the Project Explorer Window (on the left side)
Select Import... and select Existing Projects Into Workspace
Navigate to the newly created project folder you just moved out of the workspace
The project will highlight as one that can be imported
Ensure 'copy projects into workspace' is ticked, then click Finish.
The new project will appear in your project explorer, right click it,
Now select Build Configurations > Set Active > Device-Release,
Double click the bar-descriptor.xml file from the Project Explorer
Select the Application tab (second tab at the bottom of the XML dialog window
Change the name AGK Player to the name of your app,
Now select Clean Project to ensure we're working with the latest files
When you select Build Project, the application should be built successfully
Now right click the project file and select Export
Open Blackberry Tablet OS and select Release Build then click Next
Do not click Finish, and instead click the Next button again,
Now click the Finish button to perform and final build and sign of your package
Ensure you increment the version and/or build number after each successfully signed package file
_listend

_text
If successful, your final .bar file is located in the Device-Release folder here:

_text
C:\ndk-2.1.0-workspace\myapp\Device-Release\myapp-1_1_0_10.bar (example)

_text
This is the "file bundle" you will be asked for when you submit to the App World Developer portal (you will need to make a zip file of it first).
