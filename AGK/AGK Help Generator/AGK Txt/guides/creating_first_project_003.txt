AppGameKit will automatically provide you with a basic program that can be used as a starting point for your project. Here's what it looks like.

_tier1
// Project: First project 
// Created: 2017-01-10

// show all errors
SetErrorMode(2)

// set window properties
SetWindowTitle( "First project" )
SetWindowSize( 1024, 768, 0 )

// set display properties
SetVirtualResolution( 1024, 768 )
SetOrientationAllowed( 1, 1, 1, 1 )
SetSyncRate( 30, 0 ) // 30fps instead of 60 to save battery
UseNewDefaultFonts( 1 ) // since version 2.0.20 we can use nicer default fonts

do
    Print( ScreenFPS() )
    Sync()
