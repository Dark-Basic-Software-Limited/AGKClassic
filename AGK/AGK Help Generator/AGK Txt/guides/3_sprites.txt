Sprites

Overview
_text
This guide provides an overview of sprites and some of their associated commands.

_sheader
What is a sprite?
_text
Sprites sit at the core of AGK and are used as a way of representing images on screen.

_sheader
How do I create a sprite?
_text
A sprite can be created by calling the <i>CreateSprite</i> command:

_tier1
CreateSprite ( id, image )
id = CreateSprite ( image )
_tier1

_tier2
void CreateSprite ( UINT id, UINT image );
UINT CreateSprite ( UINT image );
_tier2

_text
A sprite can be created by either assigning an ID number manually or having it provided to you automatically. The next step is to provide an ID number of an image. The image gets attached to the sprite and will later be drawn on screen. Please note that ID numbers are unique for a command set. Therefore it's feasible to have a sprite ID of 1 along with an image ID of 1.

_text
Here's one approach to creating a sprite. This example loads an image into ID slot 1. This is followed by a call to <i>CreateSprite</i>, passing in an ID number of 1 for the sprite and also letting the command know that we'll be attaching image 1 to this sprite. 

_tier1
LoadImage ( 1, "myImage.png" )
CreateSprite ( 1, 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage ( 1, "myImage.png" );
agk::CreateSprite ( 1, 1 );
_tier2

_text 
This alternative method demonstrates how an image can be loaded and a sprite created with automatically assigned ID numbers:

_tier1
image = LoadImage ( "myImage.png" )
sprite = CreateSprite ( image )
_tier1

_tier2
image = agk::LoadImage ( "myImage.png" );
sprite = agk::CreateSprite ( image );
_tier2

_sheader
How can I position a sprite?
_text
The main command for setting a sprite's position is called <i>SetSpritePosition</i>. This command takes 3 parameters:

_listbegin
ID
X position
Y position
_listend

_text
The ID number refers to the ID of the sprite you want to position, while the X and Y positions will refer to percentages or screen coordinates.

_text
When using the percentage based system, to position a sprite at 25% along the X axis and 75% along the Y axis:

_tier1
LoadImage ( 1, "myImage.png" )
CreateSprite ( 1, 1 )

SetSpritePosition ( 1, 25, 75 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage ( 1, "myImage.png" );
agk::CreateSprite ( 1, 1 );

agk::SetSpritePosition ( 1, 25, 75 );
_tier2

_text
If a virtual resolution was being used, the above code would be setting the sprites position to 25 pixels along the X axis and 75 pixels down the Y axis.

_sheader
How can I set the visibility of a sprite?
_text
A sprite will be visible as soon as it has been created. For times when you need to alter the visibility use the command <i>SetSpriteVisible</i>. This command takes 2 parameters:

_listbegin
ID
visible state
_listend

_text
The ID number refers to the ID of the sprite you want to alter, while a visible state of 0 will hide the sprite and a state of 1 will show it.

_sheader
How can I delete a sprite?
_text
Call the <i>DeleteSprite</i> command to remove a sprite:

_tier1
DeleteSprite ( id )
_tier1

_tier2
void DeleteSprite ( UINT id );
_tier2

_text
This command only requires the ID number of the sprite you want to delete. Here's an example of creating a sprite and deleting it:

_tier1
LoadImage ( 1, "myImage.png" )
CreateSprite ( 1, 1 )
DeleteSprite ( 1 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::LoadImage ( 1, "myImage.png" );
agk::CreateSprite ( 1, 1 );
agk::DeleteSprite ( 1 );
_tier2
