_sheader
Description

_text
This command will allow your program to perform a sequences of commands based on the result of a condition. If the condition is true any commands that follow are performed. If the condition is false any following commands are skipped.

_text
When an <i>if</i> statement is followed by the <i>then</i> keyword then only the next statement is affected.

_text
An alternative approach to using an <i>if</i> statement is to ignore the <i>then</i> keyword. In this instance a number of lines of code can be executed. If you take this approach to finish the conditional check add <i>endif</i>.
