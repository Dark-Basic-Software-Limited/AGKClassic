#insert filename$

_sheader
Description

_text
You can use this command to simplify your main program by writing sub-programs that hold re-usable independent functions. It is similar to #include except the code from the inserted file will be inserted into the main program at the location where #insert is called. In other words the #insert line will be replaced with the contains of the inserted file.

_text
If you insert the same file more than once then you cannot declare any variables, functions, or types in the inserted file as they will be declared twice and cause a compiler error.
