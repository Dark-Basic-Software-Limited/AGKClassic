_sheader
Description

_text
This command will allow your program to perform two different sequences of commands based on the result of a condition. If the condition is true, the commands immediately following the <i>if</i> command are performed. If the condition is false, the commands immediately following the <i>elseif</i> command are checked and if this statement is true the commands following it are used. You must always use an <i>endif</i> to mark the end of the <elseif> command sequence.
