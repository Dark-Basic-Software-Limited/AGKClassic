Description

_text
Constants are special tokens that can be defined to hold a fixed value or string. You can use the constants anywhere in your program to specify items of data that are not going to change throughout your programs execution.

_text
Constants can be used to increase performance of your programs and make your code easier to read. Beware that using constant names that match reserved words like <i>print</i> will cause your program to change radically and should be avoided.
