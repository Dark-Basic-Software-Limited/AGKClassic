The <i>rem</i> command indicates the start of a "remark" in your program, and all remarks are skipped by the compiler. You can use remarks to provide a better description of what your program is doing. It is good practice to make remarks on a regular basis.

_text
An alternative to using the <i>rem</i> command is to place <i>//</i> at the start of a line.
