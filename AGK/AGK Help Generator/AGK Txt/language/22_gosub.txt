_sheader
Description

_text
This command will jump to the specified label in the program. Unlike the <i>goto</i> command, you can use the <i>return</i> command to return to the program location of the last jump performed. In order to use the <i>gosub</i> command you must create a subroutine in your program that terminates with the <i>return</i> command. To create a subroutine you must write a label in your program followed by a sequence of commands. The label can be made up from any combination of alphabetic characters, but you must end the declaration of the label using a colon(:). You only need to use a colon when you are declaring the label, and should not be used when calling the label from a <i>gosub</i> command.
