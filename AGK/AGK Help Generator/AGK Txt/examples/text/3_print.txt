Basic print commands

_sheader
Description
_text
A set of print commands are provided with AGK. Their purpose is to provide a very quick and effective way of outputting text on screen, which is particularly useful for debugging.

_text
This example will demonstrate how the print commands can be used.

Printing text
_text
The <i>Print</i> command takes one parameter. It will accept a string, an integer or a floating point variable. These lines of code demonstrate printing out the different types:

_tier1
Print ( "some text" )
Print ( 123 )
Print ( 9.473 )
_tier1

_tier2
agk::Print ( "some text" );
agk::Print ( 123 );
agk::Print ( 9.473f );
_tier2

_text
After calling these commands the contents will be output on screen, with each subsequent call to <i>Print</i> generating a new line.

Printing properties
_text
It's possible to adjust size, spacing and color properties for printing text on screen.

_text
The command <i>SetPrintSize</i> controls the size of printed text. It only takes one parameter that controls the size. Increase the size to have larger text printed. The default size is calculated based on whether you have specified an aspect ratio or are using a virtual resolution.

_text
The command <i>SetPrintSpacing</i> controls the spacing between characters. This command takes one parameter that controls the spacing. By default this is 0 meaning there are no spaces between characters. Use a larger value to increase spacing between characters.

_text
The command <i>SetPrintColor</i> takes four parameters: red, green, blue and alpha values. This command is used to control the color of text displayed with the <i>Print</i> command. By default all of these values are 255, which will display white text on screen.

Full code listing
_text
Our final program makes three calls to the <i>Print</i> command:

_tier1
backdrop = CreateSprite ( LoadImage ( "background3.jpg" ) )
SetSpriteColorAlpha ( backdrop, 200 )
SetSpriteSize ( backdrop, 100, 100 )
<br>
do
    Print ( "some text" )
    Print ( 123 )
    Print ( 9.473 )
<br>
    Sync ( )
loop
_tier1

_tier2
void app::Begin ( void )
{
    int backdrop = agk::CreateSprite ( agk::LoadImage ( "background3.jpg" ) );
    agk::SetSpriteColorAlpha ( backdrop, 200 );
    agk::SetSpriteSize ( backdrop, 100, 100 );
}
<br>
void app::Loop ( void )
{
    agk::Print ( "some text" );
    agk::Print ( 123 );
    agk::Print ( 9.473 );
<br>
    agk::Sync ( );
}
_tier2

Making sure text is on screen
_text
Any text printed out by the <i>Print</i> command will be displayed when the <i>Sync</i> command is called. At this point any text within the print buffer will be cleared. Therefore if you made a call to <i>Print</i> outside of your main loop then the text would be flashed on screen and then disappear. To ensure text with the <i>Print</i> command is displayed on screen then it's advisable to call <i>Print</i> within your main loop.

Conclusion
_text
The <i>Print</i> command is ideal for quickly displaying text on screen. If you need extra control and customization then it's advisable to use the text commands.
